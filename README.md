# txt-zipf-watson-analysis
Uses the watson API to analyze the 'personality' of all txt files in a given directory. Analyzes word frequency (Zipf's law). Stores this information in mongodb as a document per file. I personally used this once on 707 txt-files ranging from 3mb (personal choice) to 20mb (watson upper data input limit).

Also look at my other repos 'pyroselytism' and 'author-grouping', they were used in preparing my files to fit this program.
